# Key-based

I have did the assignment  using the typescript and html in angular framework.

while entering the key it validates if length of the key exceeds beyond then it gives you warning.key should not be number or special character.
value should not go beyond 16 kb.I have validated the value too.

validation and logics   placed in the typecript and  warning,details required are displayed in html.
